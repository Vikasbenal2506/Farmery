    <p>
        <span>Organic Products:</span> <br>
Soil organic matter is the fraction of the soil that consist of plant or animal tissue in various stages as decomposition .
Most of our productive agricultural soils have between 3 and 6% organic matter. <br> <br>
Organic matter is made up of: <br>
1) Plant residues and living microbial biomass. <br>
2) Active soil organic matter also referred to as detritus. <br>
3) Stable soil organic matter, often referred to as humus. <br> <br>
The living microbial biomass includes the micro-organisms responsible for decomposition of both plant residuces and
active stable fraction of the soil organic matter that is formed from decomposed plant and animal tissue . <br> <br>
<span>Physical Benefits:</span> <br>
 • Enhances aggregate stability, improving water infiltration and soil aeration, reducing runoff. <br>
 • Improve water infiltration and soil aeration, reducing runoff. <br>
 • Reduces the stickiness of clay soil making then easier to fill. <br>
 • Reduces surface crusting, facilitating seedbed preparation. <br> <br>
 <span>Chemical Benefits:</span> <br>
 • Increase the soil's CEC or its ability to hold onto and supply over time essential nutrients such as calcium, magnesium and potassium . <br>
 • Improves the ability of a soil to resist pH changes. <br>
 • Accelerates decomposition of soil mineral over time making the nutrients in the minerals available for plant uptake. <br> <br>
 <span> Biological Benefits:</span> <br>
 • Provide food for the living organisms in the soil . <br>
 • Enhances soil microbial biodiversity and activity with can help in the suppression of diseases and pests. <br>
 • Enhances pore space through the actions of soil micro-organisms . This helps to increase infiltration and reduce runoff.
